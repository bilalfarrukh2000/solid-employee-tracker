# solid-employee-tracker
This application creates interfaces that make it very easy for non-developers to interact with it.

I have built a command-line application that manages a company's database. A user can view departments, roles, and employees by choosing the option from the main menu. A user can also add employees, departments, and roles by following the prompts in the command-line application.

I used Node.js, inquirer as well as MySQL.
